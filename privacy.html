  <h1>CaptionSafe Privacy Policy</h1>
  <div class="meta"><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2026-02-02</div>

  <p>CaptionSafe (“we”, “our”, “the app”) helps you prepare photos and videos for social platforms and export them to your device.</p>

  <h2>Data We Access</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Photos / Videos (Media Library):</strong> If you grant permission, CaptionSafe can access photos and videos from your device so you can preview, edit (e.g., resize, blur background, safe-zone guides), and export results.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Media is used <strong>only</strong> to provide the editing and export features inside the app.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal information.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Storage and Sharing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Edited exports are saved <strong>to your device</strong> (e.g., Photos) when you choose to export.</li>
    <li>If you use the Share feature, iOS sharing services handle delivery to other apps/services you select.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Subscriptions and Purchases</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If you subscribe to CaptionSafe Pro, purchases are processed by <strong>Apple</strong>. We do not receive your full payment information (Apple handles billing).</li>
    <li>We may receive non-identifying subscription status from Apple to unlock Pro features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Analytics (Optional)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>CaptionSafe may collect <strong>basic, anonymous usage analytics</strong> (such as app performance, crashes, and feature usage) to improve reliability and user experience.</li>
    <li>We do not collect sensitive personal data for advertising.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>CaptionSafe does not upload your media to our servers by default. Media stays on your device unless you share it via iOS.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can manage permissions anytime in <strong>iOS Settings</strong> (Photos access).</li>
    <li>You can delete exported files by removing them from your Photos app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>CaptionSafe is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
